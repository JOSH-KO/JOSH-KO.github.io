                                            Scholarship provides a space for undergraduate writers
                                            to share their work outside of the context and
                                            constraints of the college classroom. Each issue of
                                            Process centers on a topic of contemporary interest to a
                                            global audience, fostering critical conversations that
                                            transverse disciplinary, cultural, and national borders.
                                            We believe that undergraduate writing deserves serious
                                            attention, and hope to encourage writers to begin
                                            forging new pathways for the future of academic and
                                            public scholarship.</Journal-Summary>

                                            undergraduate students. We are continuously seeking
                                            quality manuscripts for publication and will consider
                                            manuscripts in any area of psychology. Although MPS
                                            primarily focuses on results from experimental research,
                                            there are also publication opportunities for theoretical

                                            majors. In particular, its purpose is to disseminate

                                            shown by its title, is that each student whose work is
                                            published has been advised by at least two different
                                            people: a subject area advisor (who typically, but not
                                            always, suggested the problem) and a mathematics

                                            Students enrolled in a CHSS course during the academic
                                            year are eligible to submit their work for publication

                                            vital component of higher education; students enhance
                                            their education when they engage in original research to
                                            make an intellectual contribution to the discipline;
                                            research shared with a broader audience enhances
                                            learning outcomes; and faculty members contribute to
                                            society when they involve undergraduates in research

      <Journal-Summary>The Grassroots Writing Research Journal is produced twice
                                            each year by the Writing Program at Illinois State
                                            University. The print issue of each journal is used as a
                                            primary text in two of ISU's undergraduate general
                                            education writing courses. Digital versions of previous
                                            issues are available online. The title of the journal
                                            reflects our aspirations—to present writing research by
                                            different authors and in a wide range of different
                                            topics, forms, and media. The journal solicits authors
                                            from within and outside of our institutions and other
                                            academic institutions. We've published faculty, graduate
                                            students, undergraduates, high school students, and
                                            nonstudents-- all Writing researchers. We encourage
                                            authors to share not only what they’ve learned about
                                            writing but also how they learned it. Thus, each new
                                            volume brings together a diverse collection of articles
                                            that all enact some form of writing research from a
                                            variety of authors. Authors can learn more about
                                            publishing on our websites, which offer both back issues
                                            of the journal and a range of different guides for

      <Journal-Summary>With the help of Fairfield University’s International
                                            Studies Program, four undergraduate students established
                                            the Undergraduate Journal of Global Citizenship in 2010.
                                            The journal was part of an AAC&amp;U Bringing Theory to
                                            Practice grant to promote responsible global citizenship
                                            and student development. The journal is designed to
                                            highlight the accomplishments of young minds in constant
                                            intellectual engagement with their surroundings. The
                                            Undergraduate Journal of Global Citizenship honors the
                                            work of undergraduates from diverse academic
                                            backgrounds, united by their dedication to global
                                            citizenship and social responsibility, in line with the
                                            Jesuit values of the university. Welcomed are
                                            undergraduate submissions that showcase and promote the
                                            understanding of global citizenship and social
                                            responsibility. We view global citizenship as a
                                            disengagement from barriers into a recognition and
                                            understanding of human actions with social, political,
                                            environmental, and/or economic impact worldwide. A sense
                                            of community, not only with our direct neighbors but
                                            also with societies and lives around the globe, makes a

      <Journal-Summary>The Columbia Undergraduate Science Journal is a
                                            peer-reviewed, professional-level, open-access, academic
                                            publication that is committed to publishing manuscripts
                                            of the highest scholarship resulting from significant
                                            scientific research or outstanding scientific analysis.
                                            Each paper published in the CUSJ undergoes a
                                            double-blind peer-review process facilitated by the
                                            journal's Editorial Review Board and a faculty review by
                                            a member of the Faculty Advisory Board. The CUSJ has two
                                            primary goals. First, the CUSJ aims to (1) publish works
                                            of the highest scholarship authored primarily by
                                            undergraduates. Second, the CUSJ aims to (2) educate
                                            students about the academic publication process, both
                                            from the inside as a member of the CUSJ staff and from
                                            the outside as a submitter to a scientific journal with
                                            academic standards that are as rigorous as any
                                            professional-level scientific publication. </Journal-Summary>

      <Journal-Summary>Consilience is an online journal dedicated to promoting
                                            interdisciplinary dialogue on sustainable development.
                                            This journal aims to bring students, researchers,
                                            professors, and practitioners from a variety of
                                            disciplines and geographical regions in direct
                                            conversation with each other through an online,

                                            editorial columns, and photo essays. By providing a
                                            public platform for discussion, we hope to encourage a
                                            global community to think more broadly, thoroughly, and
                                            analytically about sustainable development. The journal

      <Journal-Summary>The Morningside Review is an online journal published by
                                            Undergraduate Writing Program at Columbia University. It
                                            features exemplary essays written by first-year
                                            undergraduates in the Core Curriculum course, University
                                            Writing. Hundreds of students voluntarily submit their
                                            essays to TMR for possible publication and approximately
                                            ten are chosen each year by an editorial advisory board
                                            made up of University Writing instructors. Since these
                                            essays serve as vivid examples of peer work, they are
                                            commonly assigned in University Writing. Students may be
                                            prompted by their instructors to identify the rhetorical
                                            strategies employed in an essay, contemplate their
                                            effectiveness, and attempt to emulate those they admire
                                            in their own work. Thus, Columbia University students
                                            may make their imprint on University Writing long after
                                            they have completed the course.</Journal-Summary>

                                            sciences at Carleton College. Our goal is to present
                                            papers that bring to light new narratives and fresh

                                            dominant perspectives, the UJHS serves as a forum for
                                            contributors and readers to reconsider their position
                                            within the context of their society. In the spirit of
                                            the liberal arts, the UJHS is a multidisciplinary

                                            subjects, demonstrating how student research can
                                            contribute to a variety of fields.</Journal-Summary>
