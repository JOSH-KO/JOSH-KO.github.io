	<h1>Hi there! I'm Josh Koepke, historian and archivist.</h1>

	<p>Pardon the dust and broken links. This website is under construction as a personal project, which unfortunately means I only get to work on it occasionally. In the meanwhile, contact me through <a href="mailto:joshua.w.koepke@gmail.com">email</a> for any information not available.</p>
